Snyk allows you to find and automatically fix vulnerabilities in your code, open source dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code — all powered by Snyk’s industry-leading security intelligence.

You can check it out [here](https://snyk.io/).

For development, especially useful are two Snyk products; **Snyk Code** and **Snyk Open Source**. The first is responsible for securing the code you write, while the second helps avoid vulnerable dependencies. Apart from that, Snyk CLI finds hardcoded secrets so that you won't push them to your repository.
