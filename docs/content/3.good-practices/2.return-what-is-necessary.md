title: Only return what is necessary
description: ''

If you just need a certain field of an object, you should only return the specific fields required. In other words, if you only need to list names of the users available, you are not returning their email addresses or credit card numbers in addition to their full names.

You can read more about this recommendation [here](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#only-return-what-is-necessary)

Fortunately, in Nuxt 3, you can utilize `pick` or use `interceptors` concepts for both `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` to sanitize what you get from the server without leaking confidential data.

You can read more about it [here](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/composables/use-fetch#example)

```ts
const { data, pending, error, refresh } = await useFetch('https://api.nuxtjs.dev/mountains',{
    pick: ['title']
})
```
