:badge[Enabled]{type="success"} Prevent unwanted content from being injected in your app.

Content Security Policy (CSP) helps prevent unwanted content from being injected/loaded into your webpages. This can mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, clickjacking, formjacking, malicious frames, unwanted trackers, and other web client-side attacks.

Default value:

```ts
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  'base-uri': ["'self'"],
  'font-src': ["'self'", 'https:', 'data:'],
  'form-action': ["'self'"],
  'frame-ancestors': ["'self'"],
  'img-src': ["'self'", 'data:'],
  'object-src': ["'none'"],
  'script-src-attr': ["'none'"],
  'style-src': ["'self'", 'https:', "'unsafe-inline'"],
  'upgrade-insecure-requests': true
}
```

## Static site generation (SSG)

This module is meant to work with SSR apps, but you can also use this module in SSG apps where you will get a Content Security Policy (CSP) support via `<meta http-equiv>` tag.

This will result in following code being added to your static app `<head>` tag:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'">
```

## `Nonce support`

To further increase CSP security, you can use a [nonce-based strict csp](https://web.dev/strict-csp/#what-is-a-strict-content-security-policy).
This can be configured as follows:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  security: {
    nonce: true,
    headers: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        'style-src': [
          "'self'",  // fallback value for older browsers, automatically removed if `strict-dynamic` is supported.
          "'nonce-{{nonce}}'",
        ], 
        'script-src': [
          "'self'",  // fallback value for older browsers, automatically removed if `strict-dynamic` is supported.
          "'nonce-{{nonce}}'",
          "'strict-dynamic'"
        ],
        'script-src-attr': [
          "'self'",  // fallback value for older browsers, automatically removed if `strict-dynamic` is supported.
          "'nonce-{{nonce}}'",
          "'strict-dynamic'"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

This will add a `nonce` attribute to all `<script>`, `<link>` and `<style>` tags in your application. 
The `nonce` value is generated per request and is added to the CSP header. This behaviour can be tweaked on a route level by using the `routeRules` option:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/api/custom-route': {
      nonce: false    // do not check nonce for this route (1)
    },
    '/api/other-route': {
      nonce: { mode: 'check' }  // do not generate a new nonce for this route, but check it against the existing one (2)
    }
  }
})
```

## Using `nonce` in your application code

There are two ways to use `nonce` in your application. Check out both of them and decide which one suits your needs best.

### With the `useHead` composable

If you are dynamically adding script or link tags in your application using the `useHead` composable, all nonce values will be automatically added.
However, take note that due to [a current bug in unjs/unhead](https://github.com/unjs/unhead/issues/136), you'll need to add a workaround **when using ssr** to prevent double loading and executing of your scripts when using nonce.

```ts
// workaround unjs/unhead bug for double injection when using nonce
// by setting the mode to 'server'
// see: https://github.com/unjs/unhead/issues/136 
useHead({ script: [{ src: 'https://example.com/script.js' }] }, { mode: 'server' })
```

### Directly inserting tags into DOM

If you are unable or unwilling to use `useHead` and are inserting directly into the DOM (e.g. `document.createElement`), you can get the current valid nonce value using the `useNonce` composable:

```ts
const nonce = useNonce()
```

You can then use it with Nuxt Image like following:

```html
<NuxtImg src="https://localhost:8000/api/image/xyz" :nonce="nonce" />
```
