title: Allowed Methods Restricter
description: ''
---

This middleware works by default for `*` HTTP Methods and will throw an `405 Method Not Allowed` error when the there will be a request sent with an HTTP Method that is not allowed.

It will help you solve [this](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#restrict-http-methods) security problem.

```ts
export type HTTPMethod = 'GET' | 'POST' | 'DELETE' | 'PATCH' | 'POST' | string;

export type AllowedHTTPMethods = HTTPMethod[] | '*'
```

To write a custom logic for this middleware follow this pattern:

```javascript
// nuxt.config.js

{
  modules: [
    "nuxt-security",
  ],
  security: {
    allowedMethodsRestricter: {
      value: ['POST'],
      route: '/my-custom-route'
    }
  }
}
```
