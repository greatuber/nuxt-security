title: Rate Limiter
description: ''
---

This middleware stores ip address of a request in memory and will throw an `429 Too Many Requests` error when there will be too many requests than the number set in the configuration. Based on <https://github.com/jhurliman/node-rate-limiter> and <https://github.com/ptarjan/node-cache>

Keep in mind that this built-in rate limiter is not suitable for complex production applications. It is meant to help simpler applications handle the issue of brute forcing. To correctly protect your production application against brute forcing you should use solutions that work on the infrastructure layer, not the application layer. Check out tools such as <https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ddos/> & <https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>.

It will help you solve [this](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#take-precautions-against-brute-forcing) security problem.

```ts
export type RateLimiter = {
  tokensPerInterval: number;
  interval: string | number;
  fireImmediately?: boolean;
};
```

To write a custom logic for this middleware follow this pattern:

```js{}[nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  security: {
    rateLimiter: {
      tokensPerInterval: 200,
      interval: "day",
      fireImmediately: false,
      throwError: false, // optional
    }
  }
})
```

Or use `routeRules` for per route configuration:

```js{}[nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/my-secret-route': {
      security: {
        rateLimiter: {
          tokensPerInterval: 200,
          interval: "day",
          fireImmediately: false
          throwError: false, // optional
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
