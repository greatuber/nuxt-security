This functionality will change in the next major release as h3-cors package was merged to core H3 package. The interface will most probably change but a proper migration process is being developed.

This middleware will help you set your CORS options. Based on <https://github.com/NozomuIkuta/h3-cors>

This middleware will help you solve [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) security problem.

```ts
export interface CorsOptions {
    origin?: '*' | 'null' | (string | RegExp)[] | ((origin: string) => boolean);
    methods?: '*' | HTTPMethod[];
    allowHeaders?: '*' | string[];
    exposeHeaders?: '*' | string[];
    credentials?: boolean;
    maxAge?: string | false;
    preflight?: {
        statusCode?: number;
    };
}
```

To write a custom logic for this middleware follow this pattern:

```js{}[nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  security: {
    corsHandler: {
      value: {
        origin: '*',
        methods: '*',

      },
      route: '/my-custom-route'
    }
  }
})
```
